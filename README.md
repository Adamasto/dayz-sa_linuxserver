# dayzsa_linuxserver

This Script is a modified fork of the <a href="https://linuxgsm.com">Linux Game Server Manager</a> to run a DayZ Standalone 1.14 Exprimental Community Server!
It make use of tmux to seperate it from the user shell. It runs completely on the console so you can run it on a Root or V-Server with limited SSH access. 


# Currently working with DayZ Standalone v1.14 Experimental!
