# dayzsa_linuxserver

This Script is a modified fork of the <a href="https://linuxgsm.com">Linux Game Server Manager</a> to run a DayZ Standalone Exprimental 0.63 Community Server!

To be able to run it on Linux, this script uses Wine to run Windows Programms on Linux! It also needs Xvfb to emulate a X-Window and tmux to seperate it from the user shell. It runs completely on the console so you can run it on a Root or V-Server with limited SSH access.
